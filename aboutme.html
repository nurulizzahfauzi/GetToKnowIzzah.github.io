            Hi and Assalamualaikum. Thank you for visiting my website! The purpose of this website is to showcase the biography of myself.
            Other than that, this website was built for my Introduction to Web Content Management and design course which is an individual 
            assignment. To start, I would like to introduce myself first. My name is <b>Nurul Izzah binti Fauzi</b> but most of the time people would 
            call me Izzah. <b>I was born in Klang, Selangor</b>. Specifically at Klinik Razif at 2:45 AM. Fun fact about that is the actual owner of 
            the clinic which is Doctor Razif was the one who delivered me in his pajamas. I am the<b>eldest daughter of my family</b> out of three 
            of my siblings.

            <li><h3>KINDERGARTEN ERA</h3></li>
            </ul>

            When I was around 5 to 6 years old, I was pretty active joining multiple competitions. I joined 
            colouring competitions, memorising “sajak kemerdekaan”, reciting National Principles on the stage in front of big crowds, 
            and even represented my kindergarten in the Dikir Barat competition. On my kindergarten graduation day, I performed in front
            of the crowd on stage alone by playing melodica which is a musical instrument like keyboard piano but you need to blow in order
            to make it produce sounds. I was also nominated for the “Tokoh Puteri” nomination which stands for best girl student in the
            kindergarten.

            <ul type="disc"> 
            <li><h3>SCHOOL ERA</h3></li>
            </ul>

            I was not really an academic achiever. I was more into sports. I was a school athlete and got tons of
            medals for running competition, passing the baton, and high jump. I also represented my school in a running competition and 
            “Merentas Desa” competition. In my secondary school era, I stopped focusing on sports especially after I got injured in primary
            school during high jump competition. I started to become an academic achiever in my secondary school. I became the secretary 
            of the handball club, the president of the history club, the vice president in class and started to focus on scoring every 
            subject that I took.

            <ul type="disc"> 
            <li><h3>UNIVERSITY ERA</h3></li>
            </ul>

            I got used to being an academic achiever and have totally quit sports. Alhamdulillah 
            I got everything that I wanted academically. Thanks to Allah for everything. In university, 
            I learned loads of new things, different types of people, leading, decision making, shaping my personality and maturity and
            many more. I am looking forward to learning more new things in life to become a better person in the future Inshaallah.
